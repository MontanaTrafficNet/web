    This net has changed to an informal net called by Doug K7YD on Sunday morning on 3.880 Frequency
    at 8:00 A.M. Mountain Standard Time. If he is not there then someone should take a turn and call
    the net. This net is just to keep everyone informed on to what is happening and information
    about items pertaining to Amateur Radio in the area. As practice W7XY takes weather reports if
    he is present and turns them into the Weather Service in Missoula, Billings, Great Falls and
    Glasgow. They really appreciate this and tell us Thanks for doing this. If you have any
    information to share or news of silent keys let the Net Control know and give it to the net.
    This is a fun net and usually lasts almost an hour so join in on the fun.
