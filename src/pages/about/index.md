title: About the Montana Traffic Net
---
This Web Site makes it easier to acquire roll call sheets and information needed to pass traffic and to make this net operational. The postage cost now would be expensive just to mail roll call sheets to the Net Control each month. We have our own domain name so we can move the net to different locations but keep the address the same so it doesn't confuse people. We wish to thank everyone that helps to make this net work.

If you find any mistakes in the roll call or any other page let me know. Spelling of names, call signs  or other wise.
