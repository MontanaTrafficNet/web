	<font color="#0000ff">
	&nbsp;Years ago someone tried to write a web site for Montana Traffic Net. <br>
	Donnie W7XY saw this and realized the person didn't know how to write code
	or <br>
	anything about doing it. There was a lot of commercials placed on it that
	the writer <br>
	didn't know about. Donnie rewrote the code and found a site and a company to
	<br>
	donate the space. For years we could get some companies to donate space<br>
	no charge for the services we provided. Donnie wrote all the code from the
	start <br>
	after the bad start. Years later nobody could be found to donate space so we
	<br>
	switched to commercial web site. We have had this for many years and now <br>
	Donnie has reached 80 years old and picked up a few medical issues. So now
	<br>
	Nick NC7BC has taken over writing the code. This way we can keep up with
	what <br>
	goes on around us. Thank you Nick for serving as web master and also Thanks
	<br>
	to Donnie for many years of managing the net and calling many nets at night.<br>
	Donnie was a little worried if something happened to him it would be tough
	for <br>
	someone to find their way in and get things going again. This to fill ever
	one in <br>
	on what is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written by old Web Master&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<strong>Greetings from Great Falls MT.</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just happened across your story about
			Darrel Moore - K7CPJ and his clandestine Ham station at the
			University of Montana, on the MTN website (Donnie Fort)</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't find&nbsp;an&nbsp; E-mail address for
			Darrel, but if you&nbsp; do, feel free to forward this to him.</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>********************</strong></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;<strong><span class="auto-style17">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style22">
			I don't remember who it was who said back in the 1800's&nbsp;something to
			the effect that </span></strong><span class="auto-style22"><strong>in regards&nbsp;to technology, &quot;everything has
			already been invented... etc.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (was that Edison?)</strong></span></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, guess you beat us to the punch by a
			few decades.....</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends and I were at the University
			of Montana back in the EARLY 1970's.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ALSO&nbsp;strung a long wire
			between the Craig - Elrod - Dunaway dorms (I lived in 341 CRAIG).&nbsp; I
			don't remember the room numbers of the other guys that actually had
			the wire out their windows, we were all on the top floors... (FATE?)</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>Several times we&nbsp;had a heavy,
			heavy&nbsp;frost, and there... very obvious and highly visable....&nbsp;was
			this THICK&nbsp;&quot;frostly line&quot; up in the&nbsp;sky between the buildings where
			NO&nbsp;wire should be !&nbsp; Being&nbsp;the geeks we were, we decided to run a
			current through that line to heat it up slightly and melt the ice,
			so that it would not be as visible.&nbsp; We would ground one&nbsp;end and
			apply voltage to the&nbsp;other.&nbsp; This worked rather well several times,
			until one day, someone of us got a bit too liberal with the
			voltage/current (we were using a variac) and&nbsp;melted the wire.&nbsp; This
			necessitated enlisting the help of yet another friend (a Senior
			Forestery major by the way)&nbsp;with a bow and arrow.&nbsp; Four tries and
			one broken window later, he managed to &quot;hit&quot; the wooden frame of the
			window across the way, and we were back in business...</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last two years, we ALL applied for
			and got rooms right next to one another in MILLER HALL top
			floor....&nbsp;South end.&nbsp; (Back then it had a flat roof, which has since
			been remodeled into a peaked roof).&nbsp;&nbsp; We BRIBED the janitor to let
			us on the roof.&nbsp; AL, I think was his name, but I might be wrong.&nbsp; He
			was a very sweet older guy, with a strong understanding and
			tolerance for youthful shenagians.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bribe consisted of a plate
			of cookies (a care package from home), and he let us on the roof to
			place an antenna.&nbsp; Part of his charity toward us, I think stemmed
			from the fact he&nbsp;thought we were &quot;pretty good kids&quot; since he never
			had a problem at &quot;OUR&nbsp;END&quot; of the dorm / floor.&nbsp; The second year we
			were there, he actually GAVE us a key to the trap door to get up to
			the roof, so that we wouldn't have to bug him when we needed
			access.&nbsp; (his idea, not ours).&nbsp; </strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, since no holes in the&nbsp;roof
			were allowed,&nbsp;the only way to secure it was to build a large &quot;X&quot;
			with lumber (Four Ten Foot 2x4) weighted down with cement blocks
			(four to a side) This held our vertical and we spread several small
			spools of 18 ga . hookup wire out as the ground radials.&nbsp; We were
			supposed to remove it each quarter, but the janitor&nbsp;let us just
			disassemble it and lay it off to the side,&nbsp;still on the roof.&nbsp; We
			had to&nbsp;remove it at the end of each year, just in case of &quot;roof
			maintenence&quot;.&nbsp; If you knew what you were looking for, you could just
			barely see the tip top of it from EDDY St, and not at all walking
			around the building.&nbsp; I'm sure some people elsewhere had seen it and
			commented, but we followed proper procedure, and got the NO HOLES
			mounting stand approved by the physical plant staff.&nbsp; It was
			grounded and according to a few of our dorm mates, caused little TVI....
			of course back then there were only a few rooms with T.V.s and there
			was NO internet to be concerned with disrupting.</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">
			<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
		<div class="auto-style17">

  <p class="auto-style17"><strong>Hi
	Donnie -</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style17"><strong>Here is
	a bit of Missoula Ham history relating to the new check-in to the MTN
	tonight - K7CPJ - of Soda Springs, ID.&nbsp; In 1958 I started school at UM
	(Montana State University in those days) and stayed in Dunaway Hall mens
	dorm.&nbsp; About the second week of school I discovered what appeared to be a
	long wire antenna strung between one wing of Craig Hall and Dunaway Hall.&nbsp;
	Being curious, I traced the wire to a window in Craig - counted the windows
	from one end -then went to that hall and counted doors and knocked.&nbsp;
	Lo-and-behold there WAS a ham living there and his name was Darrel and his
	call was K7CPJ.&nbsp; We struck up a friendship that lasted for a long time, but
	we lost track until I heard him check into the Farm net some time back and
	called him by land line to re-connect..</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style17"><strong>In the
	dorm he had a Heathkit CW transmitter (either DX 35 or DX 65 - don't
	remember) He had recently up-graded his Novice to a General and was anxious
	to get on phone.&nbsp; I gathered up some junk and built him a one tube 6L6
	Heising modulator (often referred to as &quot;choke&quot; modulation) and drove it
	with the high impedance audio output of an Allied Radio tape recorder that I
	had.&nbsp; Darrel didn't think it could possibly work, but we but hooked it into
	the B+ line to the final amp via a plug already built into the Heathkit
	backside for similar purposes.&nbsp; Other voltages were available there for the
	6L6 tube, so hook-up was relatively simple.&nbsp; We called George, W7IOJ, on the
	phone and we got on the air on - guess where ???&nbsp; (3910) and carried on a
	good QSO with a good audio report from George.&nbsp; Darrel continued to use that
	get-up for a couple years while he was at school, making contacts all over
	the country.&nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style17"><strong>I
	haven't talked to him since I got my general, so am looking forward to
	connecting sometime when conditions are compatable.&nbsp; I've listened to the
	Farm net lots of times, but never found good conditions between Soda Springs
	and Plains.&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style17"><strong>In case
	you aren't familiar with Soda Springs - it is located in the very southeast
	corner of Idaho east of the place where that ham radio outlet is located
	(don't remember the name of the town or the store - it's hell to be getting
	old Hi!)</strong></p>

  <p><span class="detailstory"><span class="auto-style17"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet idea would jam short wave
  The communication industry would like to use the electric power network of
  distribution wires to carry, along with power for your toaster and vacuum,
  very high frequency signals that could be picked up and used by your personal
  computer. This would replace your use of telephone lines to reach the
  Internet. All these power line wires already function as radio transmitting
  antennas, but the 60-cycle per second radio energy does not interfere with
  broadcast or short wave radio.</strong></span><strong><br class="auto-style17">
  <br class="auto-style17">
  </strong><span class="auto-style17"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  BPL (Broadcast by Power Line) use would insert huge numbers of signals at all
  of the so-called &quot;short wave&quot; frequencies onto the lines, superimposed on the
  60-cycle power current. The result would be a jumble of transmissions all
  across the short-wave band. To a receiver listening at any one frequency the
  result is a steady hissing noise strong enough to override any ordinary
  message being sent at that frequency.</strong></span><strong><br class="auto-style17">
  <br class="auto-style17">
  </strong><span class="auto-style17"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Proponents of the system say it will occupy all frequencies from 1800
  kilohertz to about 80,000 kilohertz. KGVO uses a frequency of 1290 kilohertz.
  Within the part of the spectrum are found stations from around the world
  (England, Berlin, Moscow, etc.), and many radio systems used by police, fire,
  marine and other services. Amateur radio operators use this band heavily to
  provide emergency service when disasters interrupt commercial communication
  systems.

  with an air raid siren running steadily on a 50-foot pole at each end of every
  alley.</strong></span><strong><br class="auto-style5">
  <br class="auto-style5">
  </strong>
  <span class="auto-style5"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; At least six important nations (e.g. Holland, Japan) have rejected this
  system. We should also. Our FCC has not taken a stance.</strong></span><strong><br class="auto-style5">
